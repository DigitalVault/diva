DigitalVault module with packages required for the application.

# Purpose

The DigitalVault project aims to preserve your digital heritage and make it accessible in various ways.

Preserving in this project means to

- scan filesystems for files that can be ingested to the DigitalVault.
- create a copy of existing documents, images, audios and videos and other files
- convert them into long lasting formats entirely based on open-source standards
- extract metadata and maintain a search index
- provide a web-based interface for the browsing, searching, previewing, importing and exporting

The Project will be of course open source as well, as open source is the key feature for long-term preservation.
